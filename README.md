I developped the famous social game "Monopoly" using Qt platform . 

# Description 
Monopoly is a popular board game that involves players buying, selling,

and trading properties in order to accumulate wealth and force their opponents into 

bankruptcy. 

Here's the rules of the game : 

Players: The game can be played by 2 to 8 players.

Goal: The goal of the game is to become the wealthiest player by owning and managing 
properties, collecting rent, and forcing opponents to go bankrupt.

Board: The game board consists of 40 spaces, including 28 properties, 4 railroads, 2 utilities, 2 taxes, and 4 corners (Go, Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail).

Money: Each player starts with $1500 in cash.

Property: Properties can be purchased by players when they land on them. Once a player owns all of the properties of a specific color group, they can start to build houses and hotels on those properties, increasing the rent that other players must pay when they land on them.

Rent: When a player lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent to the owner based on the number of houses and hotels built on the property.

Jail: If a player lands on the Go to Jail space, draws a "Go to Jail" card, or rolls three consecutive doubles, they are sent to Jail. They must either pay a fine or roll doubles to get out of Jail.

Chance and Community Chest: When a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they must draw a card and follow the instructions on the card.

Free Parking: Players do not collect any money for landing on the Free Parking space.
Go: Every time a player passes Go, they collect $200.
